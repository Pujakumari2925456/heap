                                        LETS CLEARLY SEE  NORMAL HEAP AND HEAP AFTER HEAPSORT(WHICH USES HEAPIFY TECHNIQUE)

                     
                        Say we insert values:
                        50, 30, 20, 15, 10, 8, 16

                                                              
                                                              
                                                              
                                                              
        EX-🌲 Suppose We Build a Max-Heap:                       1)heap  
                                              The Max-Heap might look like this:
       
               50
             /    \
           30      20
          /  \    /  \
        15  10  8   16
Stored in array as:
[50, 30, 20, 15, 10, 8, 16]



When you do print() of the heap array:
🖨️ Output = [50, 30, 20, 15, 10, 8, 16]                                           #see ouput
This is NOT sorted.
This only means heap property is satisfied: parent ≥ children.



                                                               2) HEAPSORT

✅ Now Do Heap Sort:
Heap sort repeatedly extracts the maximum and heapifies the rest.

Sorted array (ascending order):

🖨️ Output = [8, 10, 15, 16, 20, 30, 50]                                         #see ouput
This is sorted. The heap property is lost because the structure is flattened for sorting.
